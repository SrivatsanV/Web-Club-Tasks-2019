# Slazam_Bot

### Setting up the app on slack
* Initially create a workspace on Slack. 
* Follow this [link](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) to start creating the Slack app.
* Enter the app name and the workspace you just created.
* For **Add features and Functionality** - click **Bots** -  where you will be asked to enter a **Display Name** and a **Default Username**.
* Click **Always show my bot online** and save changes.
* Install your app to the workspace - click on **Install App** available on the dashboard.
* Collect **Bot User OAuth Access Token** from **OAuth & Permisssions** (This is stored in .env file with a variable name like - Bot_User = xoxb-***).
* Navigate to **Enable Events** and enable them.
* Now you have to add a **Request URL** for the app to communicate with your web server.
* Set the Request URL (which would be in this format - https://**xxxxxxxx**.ngrok.io ) to the public url generated by ngrok in the next step of initialisation.
* Also in the same page - Add ```message.channels``` as a **Workspace event**.

### Initialisation of the web server
* Download this folder onto your local machine.
* Then : ```npm install```
* To run the node server : ```node index.js```  --- Output would be ```Listening to 8080```  
* Run ```ngrok http 8080``` which exposes our local web server by creating a public url.

### lyrics_finder.py
* Follow this [link](https://github.com/Techcatchers/PyLyrics-Extract) for the code and to get your own custome serach engine and the google api key.
* Store the Google API key and the search engine ID in the .env file.
* Access these variables in the python script.


### Usage
* Go to your workspace and use the channel that you have specified in the ```body``` variable in ```routes/slack.js```.
